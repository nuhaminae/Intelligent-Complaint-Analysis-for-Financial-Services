Their Capital One XXXX website listed the amount I owed for the hotel I booked as {$36.00} and charged me {$130.00}. I spent 1 hour and 44 minutes on the phone with them just trying to find out why I was overcharged and to get a refund. I was transferred 5 times. The first rep said he couldn't do anything about it. I asked for a supervisor who escalated the concern and checked with their IT department to finally admit that they charged me inaccurately due to a miscalculation in taxes by the system : {$94.00} more than I authorized. Then they said they'd issue me a refund, but said the refund would be in miles and when converted back to dollar amounts it would be less money. WHAT??? I will admit that the supervisor who explained to me how this would work was hard to understand XXXX XXXX was her name ), but I couldn't understand how they overcharged me and then won't give me the full refund. However, the worst part was when XXXX transferred me again ( the third time ) to the credit card side and the rep was SO RUDE it was absurd. She was the only one who did not give me her name ( or if she did I didn't catch it, but I got all the other rep names ). I was being polite -- I expressed frustration ( but was not rude ) when she said that she was going to transfer me back to the travel rep for them to explain why I was getting the refund in miles and not a dollar amount. I said to her that I'd been on the phone for over an hour and didn't want to be transferred again, and she interrupted me and said \" Ma'am, this is the credit card department, not the trouble department ''. WOW. I asked for her supervisor and she put me on hold for 12 minutes, did not do what the other reps did, which was come back on the line and explain that another rep from the other department was going to take over and then connect me, she just automatically transferred me, but not to a supervisor but back to the travel department. I'm cancelling this card immediately after this fiasco is resolved, and despite all the frustration and amount of time it took to get anywhere, they're losing a customer because of that rep who did not give me her name. I'm disgusted with her.",
