The problem here however, is that the continued XXXX dollars per month was never included towards the dept. They just very simply kept my monies without applying it towards the overall dept. Their explanation to me was that since I did not forward the latter XXXX, the XXXX dollars served as interest towards the dept. First, there was no practical reason for them to charge me an increase of XXXX, for missing one payment, and at no time had I violated any rule, regular, or policy of agreement, with this creditor. And was consistently paying over the minimal amount initially requested monthly. I want all those XXXX dollar payments accredited to my dept balance!

         "I just had the worst experience ever with their customer service. This was my first time using the travel reward miles after having the XXXX card for several years. Their Capital One XXXX website listed the amount I owed for the hotel I booked as {$36.00} and charged me {$130.00}. I spent 1 hour and 44 minutes on the phone with them just trying to find out why I was overcharged and to get a refund. I was transferred 5 times. The first rep said he couldn't do anything about it. I asked for a supervisor who escalated the concern and checked with their IT department to finally admit that they charged me inaccurately due to a miscalculation in taxes by the system : {$94.00} more than I authorized. Then they said they'd issue me a refund, but said the refund would be in miles and when converted back to dollar amounts it would be less money. WHAT??? I will admit that the supervisor who explained to me how this would work was hard to understand XXXX XXXX was her name ), but I couldn't understand how they overcharged me and then won't give me the full refund. However, the worst part was when XXXX transferred me again ( the third time ) to the credit card side and the rep was SO RUDE it was absurd. She was the only one who did not give me her name ( or if she did I didn't catch it, but I got all the other rep names ). I was being polite -- I expressed frustration ( but was not rude ) when she said that she was going to transfer me back to the travel rep for them to explain why I was getting the refund in miles and not a dollar amount. I said to her that I'd been on the phone for over an hour and didn't want to be transferred again, and she interrupted me and said \" Ma'am, this is the credit card department, not the trouble department ''. WOW.
